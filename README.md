## 🖥️ Navigation  

1. **Data Upload**  
   - Drag and drop your dataset (limit: 200MB).  
   - Supported formats: `.csv`, `.xlsx`, `.xls`.  

2. **Climate Data Download**  
   - Browse and download pre-validated datasets.  

3. **Anomaly Detection Sensitivity**  
   - Adjust thresholds for finer or broader anomaly detection:  
     - **Low Sensitivity (e.g., 0.01)**: For minor deviations.  
     - **High Sensitivity (e.g., 0.20)**: For significant anomalies.  

4. **Developer Section**  
   - Access the configuration panel and system documentation.
